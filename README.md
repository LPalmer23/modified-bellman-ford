# modified-bellman-ford
This Python script implements a modified version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm to compute the shortest reachable path (of length â‰¥ 1) from each node in a weighted directed graph. 

Developed as part of a Boston University CS assignment in Fall 2024, the program also supports standard shortest-path computation from a given source node.
